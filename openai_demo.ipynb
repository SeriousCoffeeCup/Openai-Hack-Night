      "After running `git fetch`, you have retrieved the latest changes from the remote repository, but those changes have not been applied to your local branches yet. Here's what you should do next:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Check the Status:**\n",
      "   Start by checking the status of your branches to understand what changes have been fetched. You can use:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   git status\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Inspect the Changes:**\n",
      "   To see what changes have been fetched, you can compare your local branches to their remote counterparts. For instance, if you are on the `main` branch, you can run:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   git log HEAD..origin/main\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   This will show you the commits that are on `origin/main` but not on your local `main`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Merging Changes:**\n",
      "   If you're on a branch like `main` or `develop` and you want to integrate the changes you fetched, you'll need to merge the remote branch into your current branch. If you're on `main`, you can do:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   git merge origin/main\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   This will merge the fetched changes from `origin/main` into your current `main` branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Rebasing (Optional):**\n",
      "   Instead of merging, another approach is to rebase your branch. This can be useful if you want to maintain a linear project history:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   git rebase origin/main\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   Note that rebasing changes history, so be cautious when using rebase on shared branches.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):**\n",
      "   During the merge or rebase process, you might encounter merge conflicts. Git will notify you about these conflicts:\n",
      "   - Open the files with conflicts and decide how to resolve them.\n",
      "   - After resolving, mark them as resolved with:\n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     git add <file>\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Complete the merge or rebase process with:\n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     git merge --continue\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     or\n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     git rebase --continue\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "Always ensure that you understand the impact of the merge or rebase operations, especially when working in a collaborative environment.\n"
